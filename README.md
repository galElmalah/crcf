# CRCF - Create React Component Folder 
This is a React component folder creator for the best FED team in Wix, the legendary *Dev-Center* squad.

## Initial steps
Just run the script: `npm run build:link`.
npm install is already included in the script.

## What you get from this AWESOME tool?!
A ready to go folder with all of the boilerplate for a react component already included :smirk:.<br/>
The folder will include the following files:

1. `<componentName>.js`
2. `<componentName>.spec.js`
3. `<componentName>.driver.js`
4. `index.js`
5. `<componentName>.scss`

I'm betting you are reading this and saying to yourself "**Crap** what if I am using typeScript?!", well, no worries mate just add the **--ts** flag and all the necessary changes will be made.

## How do I use this AWESOME tool?!
Follow the steps described in the **"Initial steps:"** section and then just write in your console `crcf create <componentName>`.<br/>
The component will be created in the folder your **terminal is running on**, just like that :neckbeard::neckbeard:. <br/>
don't forget to add the **--ts** flag if you are using typeScript.
